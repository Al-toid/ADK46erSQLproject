This database entity relationship model tracks hikers tackling the Adirondack 46er challenge. This challenge involves summiting all 46 high-peaks within the Adirondack Mountain wilderness in upstate New York. This challenge encourages hikers to explore the beautiful and challenging nature of the terrain. This model provides a structured way to manage the diverse aspects of the challenge, including:  
Hikers (HIKER): Each hiker has a unique Hiker ID and attributes including first name (FNAME), last name (LNAME), age, hometown (H TOWN), phone number, email, and experience level. These attributes help track individual hiker profiles and their journey within the Adirondack Challenge.
46ers (46ER): This entity represents hikers who have completed all 46 High Peaks, with each 46er being linked to a Hiker ID (foreign key). Attributes include a unique certification number (Cert Num), completion date (Comp Date), membership status, and how long it took to finish the challenge (TIME TO FINISH) documenting the achievement if each challenge finisher.
Mountains (MOUNTAIN): Mountains have attributes such as mountain name (MT NAME), height, peak type, difficulty level (DIFF LEVEL), elevation gain(ELEV GAIN), and subrange. This data defines each peakâ€™s physical characteristics, helping hikers assess trail difficulty and elevation changes.
Trails (TRAIL): The trails entity captures key information for each trail, including Trail ID, trail name, trail marker color (TRAIL MKR CLR), condition status, difficulty level (DIFF LEVEL), and hazards. Each trail connects to a trailhead, serving as a pathway for hikers to reach specific peaks.
Trailheads (TRAILHEAD): This entity includes trailhead identifiers (Trail Head ID), trailhead names (TRAIL HD NAME), base elevation (BASE ELEV), access fees, parking capacity (PARKING CAP) , restroom availability, and seasonal access, describing accessible entry points for various trails within the Adirondacks.
Hike Logs (HIKE LOG): the log is essential for determining whether a hiker has completed the challenge, logs track each individual hike, recording attributes such as log ID, duration, date, elevation gain, and weather conditions (WEATHER CON). Each log is associated with a specific mountain (MT Name, foreign key) and trail (Trail ID, foreign key), creating a detailed record of hiking activities and environmental factors. We will also include a notes attribute, where the hiker can document any special events that may have taken place or overall description of the hike.
Gear (GEAR): This entity catalogs equipment used by hikers, with attributes including Gear ID, type, brand, weight, rating, and recommended season (REC FOR SEASON). The information on gear helps organize resources based on seasonal and hiking requirements. 
Park Rangers (PARK RANGERS): Rangers have a unique Ranger ID, with attributes covering first and last name, certification level, shift schedule, years of service, region, assignment, contact information, and reports filed. Rangers patrol and manage designated areas, contributing to safety and maintenance within the wilderness.
